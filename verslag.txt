- accuracy random vs pretrained weights:






- best learning rate: 





- data transformation pipeline: We trained the data with Rotation, horizontal and vertical flip included but made a second transformation function that also changes the brightness, contrast and saturation of the image and normalized it with a mean and standard deviation. We also moved the ToImage method to the beginning to reduce processing time. The assumption is that this would not change the accuracy much and even make it slightly less accurate but unfortunatly this was not tested.
